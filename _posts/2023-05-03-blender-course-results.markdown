# Introduction
Despite not planning to follow career working as a 3D modeler, i decided it would be usefull for my personal projects and also as a hobby to learn a little bit of Blender with an Udemy course. By the end of course i've realized as well that it was nice to understand a little bit more about my coworkers' job. This aquired skill also helps me creating more visually pleasing projects and modifying or creating simple models without rellying on third party work.  

The course proposes plenty diverse mini-projects along it's duration, and most of those had plenty of room for creativity and liberty to decide what i wanted to model as long as i used the asked tools/concepts. The goal of this post is to present the final results of those mini-projects with a short description of what has been learned.

## Well & Floating Island
The first two projects were very basic, exploring the basics of Blender like navigating, simple blocking, scaling, rotating, translating objects and using simple object materials.

## Mayan Pyramid
The idea of this project was go a little bit further than simple blocking, using the bevel, inset, extrude and loop-cut tools.

## Grimoire & Nintendo Switch
Before moving forward with the course, i've decided to create those two extra projects, they didn't introduce any new concept, my goal was just to train what i've learned so far.

## Bowling Scene
The next project taught how to apply materials to specific faces/triangles instead of the whole object (though, not using UV yet). It also taught about curve manipulation and how to generate 3D geometry using them.

## Lamp
With this project i've learned the basics of rigging and animating, as well as using IK. I've also learned about the differences between rending using Eevee or Cycles and some lightning concepts.

## Chessboard
This last low-poly project of the course taught how to use UVs, how to create simple shaders using Blender shader graph, how to organize bigger projects consisting of plenty of individual models, and of course, allowed me to further train everything else learnt so far.

## Modular Dungeon
Though i've said the previous project was the last low-poly one, there was this optional project that taught a little bit about modular models, and how to use them while creating a more complex environment. It didn't add much new technical knowledge, but it was a fun experience and trainning.

## Corgi & Human Head
These last two projects were about high poly modeling using sculpting tools. At this point it was also taught a little bit more about plenty of different modifiers and how to use them. I've also learned a little bit about efficiency and how to deal with poly count and how to apply fur using the particle system.
